{"cells":[{"source":"**Project Name:** Temperature and Heat Islands in brazilian cities\n\n**Group:**  AntÃ´nio Lampert Vargas, Carolina Cristofoli Falcao and Oscar Stiven Morales Zapata\n\n**Main idea:** Through climatic data, observe the heat island phenomenon in Brazilian cities. Correlate with urban health by finding temperatures that are prejudicial to health.\n\nThe project was subdivided into 3 tasks, scaling the complexity of data used.\n\nTask 1 - Day:\n- 1-day data, comparing different temperature data within the same city.\n- Goal: first scripts and sample results that would be found.\n\nTask 2 - Time Series, year of 2021\n- 1 year weather data\n- Goal: see the temperature oscilations throughout the days, the months and the year between two weather stations in the same city. Point out hours of health discomfort in the different regions of the city.\n\nTask 3 - Island: \n- Satellite data from the year 2021 in Porto Alegre (BRA)\n- Goal: Visualize the phenomenon in space and have temperature data for other points in the city beyond the weather stations.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nHeat islands are a complex phenomenon and many items could not be examined in depth due to the execution time of the exercise. This work does not intend to understand the phenomenon in all its complexity, but to point out possible causes and consequences based on the data presented at the end of each task.\n\nFolium library only runs at JupterLab space.
